                                In India, it is common for businesses to set up shop or enhance their existing business to increase sales during the festive season. And rightly so, since it is that one time of the year when orders pour in from every corner of the country. Companies constantly try to boost marketing, shipping quality, etc in hopes of getting the most out of this saga that lasts over a month.
                            </p>
                            <p class="blogPara">
                                But among these, the biggest challenge that businesses may face is the question of what to sell. Sure, you are ready to reap massive profits during the festive season by catering to customers all around the country; but what is your product?
    
                                Finding the ideal bunch of products for your business is nothing short of a task. It has to be in demand, easy to sell, and something that can fetch you good profits since that is the end goal of any business. But how do you find what to sell?
    
                                Well, that is exactly what we are here for! Read on to find out answers to all your questions about finding the perfect product for your business this festive season.
                            </p>
                            <h2>How to choose your product?</h2>
                             <h3><strong>1)</strong> Sell products that the season demands</h3>
                             <p class="blogPara">One of the most important rules of selling is to find products that solve problems. This is standard and has to be followed at all times. However, festive seasons demand more. In our country where festivals are almost synonymous with extravagance, going a bit creatively overboard with products may not hurt.</p>
                             <p class="blogPara">Products that always sell and even more frequently during this time are a safe bet for sure. But it is also a good idea to explore more options and create demand yourself. This will not only generate brand awareness for your company but also increase sales.</p>
                             <h3><strong>2)</strong> Do not miss festive trends</h3>

                                The point we mentioned above is about creating trends. But this is about joining the bandwagon. Trends are constantly changing; even more so during festivals. If you sense a change in the market, where demand for a certain category of product is going up, then it might be a good idea to consider selling those.
